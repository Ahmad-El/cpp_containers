# C++ Containers and Algorithms README

This project explores various C++ containers and algorithms, leveraging the power of AVL trees for `map`, `set`, and a derived `multiset`, along with other commonly used containers such as `vector`, `list`, `stack`, `queue`, and `array`.

## Containers

### 1. Map with AVL Tree

The `map` container is implemented using an AVL tree, ensuring efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations with logarithmic complexity. This provides a sorted associative container for key-value pairs.

### 2. Set with AVL Tree

Similar to the `map`, the `set` container employs an AVL tree for efficient storage and retrieval of unique elements in a sorted order. This is particularly useful when dealing with a collection of unique values.

### 3. Multiset (Derived from Set)

A `multiset` is derived from the `set` container, allowing the storage of multiple occurrences of the same value. This is achieved by relaxing the uniqueness constraint present in the `set`.

### 4. Vector

The `vector` container is a dynamic array that automatically resizes to accommodate the elements. It provides fast random access and is suitable for scenarios where the size of the container may change frequently.

### 5. List

The `list` container is a doubly-linked list that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position. It is an excellent choice when frequent insertion and removal operations are expected.

### 6. Stack

The `stack` container represents a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, allowing elements to be pushed onto and popped off the top of the stack. It is commonly used in algorithms that require a Last-In-First-Out processing order.

### 7. Queue

The `queue` container represents a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, where elements are added to the back and removed from the front. It is widely used in scenarios that demand a First-In-First-Out processing order.

### 8. Array

The `array` container is a fixed-size array, providing a simple and efficient structure when the size of the container is known at compile time. It supports random access and is generally faster than dynamic arrays for small-sized collections.

## Usage

To use these containers and algorithms in your C++ project, include the necessary header files and instantiate the desired container. Take advantage of the provided algorithms for sorting, searching, and manipulating the contents of the containers.
